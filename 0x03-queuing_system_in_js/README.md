# 0x03. Queuing System in JS

## Project Overview

This project aims to implement a queuing system using JavaScript, ES6, Redis, Node.js, and Express.js. The project involves working with Redis as a backend data store and utilizing the Kue library for queue management. The goal is to build a basic Express application that interacts with a Redis server and employs a queuing system to handle asynchronous tasks.

## Learning Objectives

By the completion of this project, you are expected to have a solid understanding of the following concepts:

- Running a Redis server on your local machine
- Executing basic operations using the Redis client
- Utilizing a Redis client with Node.js for fundamental operations
- Storing hash values in the Redis data store
- Managing asynchronous operations with Redis
- Implementing Kue as a queue system for task management
- Building a basic Express application that interacts with a Redis server
- Developing an Express application that communicates with a Redis server and utilizes a queuing system
